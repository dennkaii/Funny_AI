## ADOBE Firefly:

Seems decent, i tried a few images but the result was very odd and absurd, it
might be because of the language or my description, not sure yet but i feel it's
a very mid ai, tho its free so who cares.

## Canva AI:

Id say same as ADOBE but this one understands spanish better and seems to be
lacking the option to upload reference images.
